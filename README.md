# Low-Pass-Filtering-of-Image-using-FPGA-
-----------------------------------------

   It is based on communication between PC/Desktop and FPGA board. An image sent from the PC when sent into FPGA is low pass filtered.  An image is send using C program bit by bit and is stored into a BRAM(Block RAM) thus enabling parallel data access . The performance achieved was betterthan conventional sequential algorithms.
